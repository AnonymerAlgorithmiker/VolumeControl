To use my Volumecontrol you have to exectue one of the Four Jars with for example:
java -jar Pump_ALSA.jar

There are 2 Jars with the Pump UI and 2 Jars with the Speaker UI, choose wisely.
Each UI-Type has a version that applys a Pulseaudio or an ALSA command to change your Volume.
If have neither Pulseaudio nor ALSA you have to manually change the corresponding Line in the code, sorry.
